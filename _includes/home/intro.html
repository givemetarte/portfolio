            Hi, I'm Jaeyoon Song

        <p>
            I am a PhD student at MIT Sloan in the Information Technologies (IT) group - a subgroup of the Management Science program - where I am advised by <a class="grey" href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/thomas-w-malone">Thomas Malone</a>. 
            My research area is Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Social Computing, which are subfields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). 
            Specifically, I am interested in understanding how new technologies change work and organizations, and building interactive systems that support collaborative interactions.
